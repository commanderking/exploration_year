### About me and this blog

I'm Jeff! I appreciate the many opportunities I've had to succeed and wish more folks could have access to similar opportunities. I primarily investigate and write about topics that relate to providing more accessible opportunities for diverse learners. As I continue to grapple with these complex topics, I'm sure my perspectives will change. I hope this blog can serve as a space where I can document my latest thoughts and how those perspectives change over time with new research, reflection, and experiences.

<!-- I believe our views on what education should look like is heavily influenced by our own educational experiences. Here are a few examples from my own life:

1. Attended what I considered a nurturing suburban environment in Cherry Hill, NJ with public schools that set me up for success (i.e. [Cherry Hill High School East](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&InstName=Cherry+Hill+High+School+East&SchoolType=1&SchoolType=2&SchoolType=3&SchoolType=4&SpecificSchlTypes=all&IncGrade=-1&LoGrade=-1&HiGrade=-1&ID=340300001418))
1. Taught high school chemistry and Chinese for five years at [Camden County Technical Schools Pennsauken](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=3402670&ID=340267001412), a Title 1 vocational high school that primarily serves students from Camden, NJ (74% free lunch)
1. Taught myself to code while I was teaching in an attempt to build more engaging digital activities for my students
1. Transitioned to a software engineering role at edtech company, Curriculum Associates, where I worked for 5 years.
1. Lead the Boston EdTech Foundation, a group that organizes edtech related meetups in the Boston area -->
