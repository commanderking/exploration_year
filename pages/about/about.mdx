### About me

I'm Jeff! I'm grateful for the many opportunities I've been given to succeed and wish all students can have access to similar opportunities. I'm on a journey to figure out ways I can contribute to making that happen.

### About the blog

My thoughts on how to provide quality education opportunites continually changes as I learn and . I'm hoping this blog can serve as a space to:

1. Document my views and how they evolve over time
1. Explore different topics

As someone who's been given so many opportunities to be successful, I've struggled to figure out how I can best leverage that to help those with fewer opportunities. This blog is a documentation of that journey as I continue to learn more about the world through my professional experiences, consumption of content put forth by others in this world, and dialog with folks. Some posts may be published at a time when I'm just beginning to grapple with a topic.
