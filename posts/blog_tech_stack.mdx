I've built this blog with the help of two resources:

1. [Josh Comeau's "How I Built My Blog"](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/)
2. [Ebenezer Don's "Building a Blog with Next.js and MDX"](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2021/10/building-a-blog-with-next-js-and-mdx/)

What I've tried before:

1. [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)

The Gatsby starter blog is much quicker to get off the ground, but in recent years, I've enjoyed the developer experience of next.js, so made the switch. As I'm hoping to create some more complex components and data visualizations, I chose the framework that I have enjoyed using the most.
