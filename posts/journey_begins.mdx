At the end of 2021, I resigned from a software engineering job at an edtech company where I've worked for almost five years. While I really enjoyed my job, I wanted to pursue another number of other priorities, including:

1. Spend more time with family
1. Travel (pending COVID cooperation, of course)
1. Explore creative endeavors

The pandemic certainly played a role in expediting this break, but even had it not been for the pandemic, I may still have arrived at the same decision. Being more than 1/3 of the way to being 100 years old, I've started to feel like life is zooming past me, and will continue to do so if I did not take concrete ways to slow it down.
